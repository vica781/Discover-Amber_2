            <h1>What amber is the rarest and most expensive</h1>
            <p>
                Baltic amber is considered to be of the highest quality, which makes it very valuable. Among gemstones,
                amber can take one of the first places for its beauty and variety of colours. The palette of shades
                strikes the imagination of even the most sophisticated jewellery lovers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Baltic amber is predominantly dominated by yellow, golden-yellow colours, hence the term "amber colour".
                The colouring of amber ranges from white, yellow, brown to red. There are greenish, bluish, grey and
                even black amber. There are even subtler shades and combinations among them. Amber can be completely
                transparent or completely opaque. Amber is not always monochromatic: there are unique combinations of
                two or more colours and shades, patterns (sometimes they form the most brilliant artistic compositions).
                This is why amber becomes alluring, charming and unique.

            <h2>What is the rarest colour of amber?</h2>

                Blue is the rarest shade of amber and the most valuable. There is less and less blue amber, this
                colour has almost disappeared. Only 0.2% of all amber is blue, and this colour is usually found in
                nuggets of white amber. Blue amber was formed when resin floated by rivers to the Sambia Peninsula
                and got into the soil, which was saturated with pyrite (FeS2). Intrusions of pyrite penetrated the
                shallow cracks in the resin. This shade is most often found in white amber. Blue Baltic amber is
                different from blue Dominican amber. The bluish hue in Dominican amber is only visible under special
                lighting.

                Natural red amber is particularly rare and is only found in 0.5% of cases. Red amber can range from
                orange to dark black. The rare colour is often obtained artificially - by heating transparent amber to
                oxidise it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Red amber was formed by exposing amber to air for a long time: the oxidation process, the warmth of the
                sun, the fire in the forest. Natural oxidation takes place in the air, amber interacts with oxygen and
                gradually changes its colour. Transparent amber becomes more red; yellow and other colours become more
                concentrated. This is a very long process: the change of colour shades could be noticed only after 50-70
                years. "Old" amber is highly valued because of its "maturity" and has its own temporary patina.

                Red amber, called "dragon's blood", featured widely in the Shosoin hoards found in Japan. It was highly
                prized both for its rarity and its mystical, divine power.

                White amber is found in about 1-2% of cases. It can be distinguished by a variety of surface and
                interior textures and is often referred to as 'royal', 'imperial' or 'bony' amber, some taking white
                amber for ivory. White amber can include areas of infiltration or patterns of yellow, black, blue, green
                or clear amber. This amber is usually characterized by a variety of textures and "natural
                ornamentation". The volatile resin substances evaporated very intensively under the influence of the
                sun's heat, and the resin takes the form of foam. In one square millimetre of white amber, there can be
                approximately 1 million micro-bubbles of 0,001-0,0008 mm. in diameter. The more microbubbles in amber,
                the whiter it is.

                Green amber is also rare. It accounts for only about 2%. The greenish hue, and sometimes the
                "crystalline"/"sugar" structure, was formed after the resin was ingested by plants and reacted with the
                pigment chlorophyll, which could be found in the plants. Because of its crystalline structure, green
                amber is sometimes called "sugar amber".
