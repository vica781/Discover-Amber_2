                <p>
                    Baltic amber is considered to be of the highest quality, which makes it very valuable. Among
                    gemstones,
                    amber can take one of the first places for its beauty and variety of colours. The palette of shades
                    strikes the imagination of even the most sophisticated jewellery lovers.
                    <br>
                    Baltic amber is predominantly dominated by yellow, golden-yellow colours, hence the term "amber
                    colour".
                    The colouring of amber ranges from white, yellow, brown to red. There are greenish, bluish, grey and
                    even black amber. There are even subtler shades and combinations among them. Amber can be completely
                    transparent or completely opaque. Amber is not always monochromatic: there are unique combinations
                    of
                    two or more colours and shades, patterns (sometimes they form the most brilliant artistic
                    compositions).
                    This is why amber becomes alluring, charming and unique.

            <h3 >What is the rarest colour of amber?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Blue</strong> is the rarest shade of amber and the most valuable. There is less and less
                blue amber, this colour has almost disappeared. Only 0.2% of all amber is blue, and this colour is
                usually found in nuggets of white amber. Blue amber was formed when resin floated by rivers to the
                Sambia Peninsula and got into the soil, which was saturated with pyrite (FeS2). Intrusions of pyrite
                penetrated the shallow cracks in the resin. This shade is most often found in white amber. Blue Baltic
                amber is different from blue Dominican amber. The bluish hue in Dominican amber is only visible under
                special lighting.

                Natural <strong>red amber</strong> is particularly rare and is only found in 0.5% of cases. Red amber
                can range from orange to dark black. The rare colour is often obtained artificially - by heating
                transparent amber to oxidise it.
                <br>
                Red amber was formed by exposing amber to air for a long time: the oxidation process, the warmth of the
                sun, the fire in the forest. Natural oxidation takes place in the air, amber interacts with oxygen and
                gradually changes its colour. Transparent amber becomes more red; yellow and other colours become more
                concentrated. This is a very long process: the change of colour shades could be noticed only after 50-70
                years. "Old" amber is highly valued because of its "maturity" and has its own temporary patina.
                <br>
                Red amber, called "dragon's blood", featured widely in the Shosoin hoards found in Japan. It was highly
                prized both for its rarity and its mystical, divine power.

                <strong>White amber</strong> is found in about 1-2% of cases. It can be distinguished by a variety of
                surface and interior textures and is often referred to as 'royal', 'imperial' or 'bony' amber, some
                taking white amber for ivory. White amber can include areas of infiltration or patterns of yellow,
                black, blue, green or clear amber. This amber is usually characterized by a variety of textures and
                "natural ornamentation". The volatile resin substances evaporated very intensively under the influence
                of the sun's heat, and the resin takes the form of foam. In one square millimetre of white amber, there
                can be approximately 1 million micro-bubbles of 0,001-0,0008 mm. in diameter. The more microbubbles in
                amber, the whiter it is.

                <strong>Green amber</strong> is also rare. It accounts for only about 2%. The greenish hue, and
                sometimes the "crystalline"/"sugar" structure, was formed after the resin was ingested by plants and
                reacted with the pigment chlorophyll, which could be found in the plants. Because of its crystalline
                structure, green amber is sometimes called "sugar amber".

                <strong>Transparent amber</strong> (with a yellowish tint). About 10% of amber is transparent, but they
                are mostly small pieces. Large transparent amber pieces are especially rare and valuable. This colour of
                amber can be called the "primary" colour - it is what fresh tree resin looks like. The resin flowed
                somewhere in the shade; therefore, the terpenes, the volatile components of the resin, evaporated slowly
                and did not pollute the resin with gas bubbles, so that amber remained transparent. The shade of
                transparency could vary from yellowish to dark red; this depended on the degree of amber oxidation. If
                successive streams of resin were stacked in layers, amber was formed layered. It is this amber that
                contains the most inclusions.

                <strong>Black amber</strong> is a fairly frequent colour, around 15%. The resin was thoroughly mixed
                with remnants of bark and leaf litter. Sometimes there might only be 10-15% resin, with the rest being
                impurities. Therefore, black amber is more fragile than other amber colours, and difficult for artists
                to work with. Black amber often features attractive natural patterns, textures or inclusions.

                <strong>Yellow</strong> is the most common colour, occurring in about 70% of cases, representing various
                shades of yellow, but this type of amber is often cloudy rather than clear. Resin dripped from trees
                under the scorching sun, the volatile components of the resin evaporated and made it turbid - thousands
                of small gas bubbles formed. These bubbles refract light, producing a yellow colour. One square
                millimetre of yellow amber may contain 2500 gas bubbles of 0,05-0,0025 mm in diameter. The more bubbles,
                the lighter the shade of yellow.

            <p>
                Prices for amber can range from £16,200 to £32,300 or more. Dominican blue amber, the most expensive
                type of amber. Transparent amber is more valuable than cloudy material. Interesting inclusions of plants
                or animals increase the value of a piece. The highest values are given to pieces with clearly visible
                insect inclusions, light colours and transparency.
