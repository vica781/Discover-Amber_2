[View the live project here](https://elainebroche-dev.github.io/ms1-thrive/)

Welcome to my website **Discover Amber** dedicated to promoting awareness about the beauty and value of amber! Amber is a natural fossilized resin that has been prized for thousands of years for its warm, golden colour and unique inclusions. My website is dedicated to providing accurate and informative information about this fascinating material, including its uses in art, jewellery and different industries; rare types. Whether you're a collector, students of arts and crafts, science or geology, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of nature, I hope you'll find something of interest on this site. 

This website is first of five Milestone Projects required to complete the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development with The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users applying all of the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.

##  **FEATURES**

### **Existing Features**

-   **Navigation Bar**

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all five pages of the website supporting easy navigation.
    
      It includes a simple Logo, HOME, USAGE, RARE AMBER, GIFRS and CONTACT ME links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  
         
    - *On a large* screens tabs for all pages are visible;
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_large_screen_acrive.webp)
    - *Active page* tab is identified as a button of orange colour;
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_large_screen_navigating.webp)
    - *During navigation* through the tabs user is assisted by change of tab colour on hover to green
    - Navigation through *Medium and Small screens* assisted by a 'hamburger' drop-down menu with transparent colour matching background and colour distinguished tabs
      <br>
      (the decision about 'hamburger' menu has been implemented to avoid nav bar going into two and more lines, and to save space on smalle screens)
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_drop_down_menu.webp) <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_drop_down_menu.webp" width="75%">

      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_medium_screen_active.webp)
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_medium_screen_navigating.webp)

-   **The Landing Page Animated panels, Logo and call to action**

    - Home Page has been equipped with three side-by-side animated (expanding on hover) panels. These panels are: USAGE, RARE AMBER and GIFTS. Panels are serving not just as a visual fixture, but thematically linked to relevant pages and can be used as navigation points to these pages. There is cursor pointer on hover to guide a user.

    - The choice of images on the Landing Page was not accidental. Images were selected to convey a sense of curiosity through an unusual (in relation to a traditional understanding of amber) objects like violin, beautiful blue stones and impressive ring with a green stone. On selection of the Landing Page images a colours chime has been taken in consideration too.  

    ![Landing Area](./assets/image/readme_page/animated_panels.webp) 
    <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/animated_panels.webp" width="75%">

-   **Logo**

    - **Discover Amber** - website Logo has been linked to home page for user convenience.   
    - The Logo **Discover Amber** in connection with Landing Page **animated panels**, occupying the central part of the screen, together are eye-catching call to action to go ahead and explore.  

-   **Gifts Page Image Gallery**

    - Images in the gallery are accompanied by information at the back of the image to provide user with a descriptive information about the materials were used to produce it, size and colour scheme. As the size of the images varies as well as the amount of the content, the information cards at the back of the images equipped by a scroll bar for convenience of the user.

    ![Gallery](./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery.webp)
    <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery" width="60%">
    
-   **Back-to-top button** on Gifts Page

    - **Gifts Gallery** page equipped with back-to-top button to assist user and give opportunity to return to the top of the page in one click. 

    ![Gallery](./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery_1.webp)  

-   **Footer**

    - For consistancy and intuativeness of brousing, as expected by user, **footer** has been placed at the bottom of all six pages (that including "Error" 404 page).
      - Footer provides user with an oportunity to follow the website on social media platforms.
      - Also, footer displays ways to contact website owner.
      - At the very bottom part of the footer has been placed a **disclaimer** stating that the website is created strictly for educational purposes as a part of Full Stack 
        Development Cours with Code Institute. This is to indicate that this is not a 'real' website and no materials (images, text, information, etc.) obtained from the various Internet resources under no circumstances are going to be used for the commercial purposes.   

     ![Footer](./assets/image/readme_page/footer.webp)

-   **Contact Me Page**

      - The 'Send Me a message' from of the Contact Me page allows the user to send a message, ask question or give feedback.
        - The user is asked to provide their name, email address and telephone number.
        - Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they 
          submitted displayed)
        
    ![Send me a message](./assets/image/readme_page/comtactme_form.webp)

## **FEATURES WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE**

-  **Logo Image** next to Discover Amber Logo corresponding with website's favicon. This is should be an easy fix, but I was not able to find that fix despite multiple  
   different attempts 
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/favicon_logo_discover_amber.webp)

   - Just, as I writing this lines, decidet to try again. Below is the results:
     - The navigation tabs moved to the line under the nav-bar. 

   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue.webp) 
   
     - The 'hamburger' menu background with the content displaysed on all screen sizes, for some widths worth than others. 
       The decision has been made to return back to previous layout and work on the improvement at the later date.
   
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue_1.webp) 
   <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery" width="60%">
   
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue_2.webp)

- **History Page** - the original design of the website, until last few days before the Project dead line, contained four animated panels on the Landing Page. Realising that I have over estimated my abilities, experience and personal circumstances, I had to take note of advice and 'cut down' on the volume of the website. As the History Page was not quite finished, I made a decision to save it for the later development. The page originally meant to contain natural history of the amber, physical and chemical properties; information about amber inclusions and value they present to the modern scientist.
   ![Histori_Page](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/history_home.png)

   ![History_Page](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/history.png)    





- __Company Timeline__
    - A 'Company Timeline' page could be added to provide more information on the evolution of the business for users who would like to know more about the origins of the company, its ethos and its involvement with the community.

- __Navigation bar improvements__
    - The functionality of the navigation bar could be extended to make it "sticky" so that it would be available to the user without scrolling.
    - A hamburger menu could be implemented to save space on smaller screens.





## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero and large background images have been chosen because they are eye-catching, fresh and bright.  The citrus and light pastel colours in the images were chosen to help convey a sense of energy, health and freshness.  The images depict fruit to align with the main business goal of selling juices and smoothies and were chosen for their "simplicity" (- e.g. a single type of fruit or repeating theme) to help keep the site clear and easy to use.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A citrus/pastel palette was chosen to convey a fresh, energetic mood.  The colours picked were inspired by a palette from [Lily Bug Design](https://www.lilybugdesign.co.nz/colour-wall)

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/supp-images/citruspalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Lato and Oswald fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.

-   ### Wireframes

    -   #### Main Page Wireframes

        ![Main](documentation/wireframes/index-page.png)

    -   #### Menu Page Wireframes

        ![Menu](documentation/wireframes/menu-page.png)
