## Site Info

Welcome to my website **Discover Amber** dedicated to promoting awareness about the beauty and value of amber! Amber is a natural fossilized resin that has been prized for thousands of years for its warm, golden colour and unique inclusions. My website is dedicated to providing accurate and informative information about this fascinating material, including its uses in art, jewellery and different industries; rare types. Whether you're a collector, students of arts and crafts, science or geology, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of nature, I hope you'll find something of interest on this site. 

This website is first of five Milestone Projects required to complete the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development with The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users applying all of the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.

## Deployment
* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab 
  * From the left side menu select **Pages**.
  * From the source section drop-down menu, select the **main** branch and click on **save**.
  * Once the main branch has been selected and saved, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

The live link can be found here - https://tomdu3.github.io/smiling-depression/.

*The site was previously deployed on the following address https://tomdu3.github.io/CI-project-1/, but the developer renamed the repository and subsequently the deployment live link was changed.*

## Issues and Bugs 

The developer ran into several issues during the development of the website, with the noteworthy ones listed below, along with solutions or ideas to implement in the future.

* **Responsiveness** - In his first attempt at styling the web page, the developer started with a desktop-sized screen. He found this approach more difficult whilst the majority of the courses online (including the Code Institute Course) were suggesting and describing the mobile-first approach. The developer overcame this issue by starting anew with the suggested approach of styling.

* **Side-scrolling** - That was quite visible in the navbar and sections with combined text and image elements. There were different instances of side-scrolling with extra white space. The main reason for these issues was the *overuse* of non-responsive sizing (mainly px). That was solved with the primary use of responsive size units.

* **Stretching of the elements** - There were initial issues with the div with image elements overstretching because of the corresponding div with text because of the content distributing in more lines on smaller screens. The issue was solved by the use of media queries with different font sizes and element direction rules.

* **An extra double quote in class Bug** - There was a bug caused by the automatic additon of the quotes in VS code with a residue of an extra double quote character after the id attribute in short-image-one. That was pointed out by an HTML validator and subsequently corrected.

* **Section lacks heading Bug** - There were issues with section elements where headings were missing. Because the developer wanted the content to be only a paragraph/text without headings, the div was chosen instead of the section element.

* **Wrong end tag** - There was a bug regarding the h2 element in the contact section. In the previous version of the code, the developer had an h3 element but was advised by the validator to respect the progressiveness of the heading tags. The developer then changed the h3 tag to h2, but without changing the closing tag - hence the bug. This was corrected.

* **Deprecated frameborder attribute on the iframe element Bug** - When copying the embed code from a YouTube video, the code contains a deprecated attribute *frameborder*. The HTML validator pointed out this issue and the code the attribute was omitted and the valid css border rule was left. The same issue was found in the embed code from Google Maps and was corrected in the same manner.

* **Character reference missing a semicolon Bug** - There was a bug in the character reference where it wasn't terminated by a semicolon (&_nbsp;).

* **Icon not centered in navbar Bug** - When on smaller screens, the navbar splits from one line into two lines, where the icon which was on the left goes at the top and is supposed to be centered. It was a bit off because of the left padding that was applied on big screens. The padding was removed on smaller screens so that the icon could be perfectly centered.

* **Mouse not changing to a pointer at submit button Bug** - The mentor pointed out that the submit button should cause the mouse indicator to change into a pointer when hovering over it. This bug was corrected.

* **Text Area Resizible bug** - In the Contact Us form the textarea that was supposed to be of a fixed size was resizable. That was changed after the mentor pointed it out.

### User testing
My friends, family and co-workers were asked to review the site and documentation, to test the links and to try to find any bugs and user experience issues. With their insightful comments and especially Mentor's guidance, the site went through some changes to the UX experience and some other choices of the overall function were made.
