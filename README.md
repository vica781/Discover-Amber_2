[View the live project here](https://elainebroche-dev.github.io/ms1-thrive/)

Welcome to my website **Discover Amber** dedicated to promoting awareness about the beauty and value of amber! Amber is a natural fossilized resin that has been prized for thousands of years for its warm, golden colour and unique inclusions. My website is dedicated to providing accurate and informative information about this fascinating material, including its uses in art, jewellery and different industries; rare types. Whether you're a collector, students of arts and crafts, science or geology, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of nature, I hope you'll find something of interest on this site. 

This website is first of five Milestone Projects required to complete the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development with The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users applying all of the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.

##  **FEATURES**

### **Existing Features**

-   **Navigation Bar**

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all five pages of the website supporting easy navigation.
    
      It includes a simple Logo, HOME, USAGE, RARE AMBER, GIFRS and CONTACT ME links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  
         
    - *On a large* screens tabs for all pages are visible;
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_large_screen_acrive.webp)
    - *Active page* tab is identified as a button of orange colour;
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_large_screen_navigating.webp)
    - *During navigation* through the tabs user is assisted by change of tab colour on hover to green
    - Navigation through *Medium and Small screens* assisted by a 'hamburger' drop-down menu with transparent colour matching background and colour distinguished tabs
      <br>
      (the decision about 'hamburger' menu has been implemented to avoid nav bar going into two and more lines, and to save space on smalle screens)
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_drop_down_menu.webp) <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_drop_down_menu.webp" width="75%">

      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_medium_screen_active.webp)
    
      ![Navbar](./assets/image/readme_page/navbar_medium_screen_navigating.webp)

-   **The Landing Page Animated panels, Logo and call to action**

    - Home Page has been equipped with three side-by-side animated (expanding on hover) panels. These panels are: USAGE, RARE AMBER and GIFTS. Panels are serving not just as a visual fixture, but thematically linked to relevant pages and can be used as navigation points to these pages. There is cursor pointer on hover to guide a user.

    - The choice of images on the Landing Page was not accidental. Images were selected to convey a sense of curiosity through an unusual (in relation to a traditional understanding of amber) objects like violin, beautiful blue stones and impressive ring with a green stone. On selection of the Landing Page images a colours chime has been taken in consideration too.  

    ![Landing Area](./assets/image/readme_page/animated_panels.webp) 
    <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/animated_panels.webp" width="75%">

-   **Logo**

    - **Discover Amber** - website Logo has been linked to home page for user convenience.   
    - The Logo **Discover Amber** in connection with Landing Page **animated panels**, occupying the central part of the screen, together are eye-catching call to action to go ahead and explore.  

-   **Gifts Page Image Gallery**

    - Images in the gallery are accompanied by information at the back of the image to provide user with a descriptive information about the materials were used to produce it, size and colour scheme. As the size of the images varies as well as the amount of the content, the information cards at the back of the images equipped by a scroll bar for convenience of the user.

    ![Gallery](./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery.webp)
    <img scr="./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery" width="60%">
    
-   **Back-to-top button** on Gifts Page

    - **Gifts Gallery** page equipped with back-to-top button to assist user and give opportunity to return to the top of the page in one click. 

    ![Gallery](./assets/image/readme_page/gifts_page_gallery_1.webp)  

-   **Footer**

    - For consistancy and intuativeness of brousing, as expected by user, **footer** has been placed at the bottom of all six pages (that including "Error" 404 page).
      - Footer provides user with an oportunity to follow the website on social media platforms.
      - Also, footer displays ways to contact website owner.
      - At the very bottom part of the footer has been placed a **disclaimer** stating that the website is created strictly for educational purposes as a part of Full Stack 
        Development Cours with Code Institute. This is to indicate that this is not a 'real' website and no materials (images, text, information, etc.) obtained from the various Internet resources under no circumstances are going to be used for the commercial purposes.   

     ![Footer](./assets/image/readme_page/footer.webp)

-   **Contact Me Page**

      - The 'Send Me a message' from of the Contact Me page allows the user to send a message, ask question or give feedback.
        - The user is asked to provide their name, email address and telephone number.
        - Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they 
          submitted displayed)
        
    ![Send me a message](./assets/image/readme_page/comtactme_form.webp)

## **FEATURES WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE**

-  **Logo Image** next to Discover Amber Logo corresponding with website's favicon. This is should be an easy fix, but I was not able to find that fix despite multiple  
   different attempts 
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/favicon_logo_discover_amber.webp)

   - Just, as I writing this lines, decidet to try again. Below is the results:
     - The navigation tabs moved to the line under the nav-bar. 

   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue.webp) 
   
     - The 'hamburger' menu background with the content displaysed on all screen sizes, for some widths worth than others. 
       The decision has been made to return back to previous layout and work on the improvement at the later date.
   
   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue_1.webp)

   ![favicon_logo](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/favicon_logo_discover_amber_issue_2.webp)

- **History Page** - the original design of the website, until last few days before the Project dead line, contained four animated panels on the Landing Page. Realising that I have over estimated my abilities, experience and personal circumstances, I had to take note of advice and 'cut down' on the volume of the website. As the History Page was not quite finished, I made a decision to save it for the later development. The page originally meant to contain natural history of the amber, physical and chemical properties; information about amber inclusions and value they present to the modern scientist.
   ![Histori_Page](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/history_home.png)

   ![History_Page](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/history.png)    

- **Scrolling Background** - I would like to learn how to stop background to scroll behind 'hamburger' menu when the latter is in use. I have studied some resources and tried to implement few suggestions, but the issue is still remaining.

   ![scrolling_background](./assets/image/readme_page/issues/scrolling_background.png) 

- **Language Button** - there are few reasons I would liked to add a Language button to my website:
  - Amber is mined in many regions of the world, but the largest deposit is on the Baltic Sea, in the Kaliningrad region. The Kaliningrad Amber Combine is the only official amber mine in Russia and accounts for 65% of the global amber market. Region holds 90% of the world's extractable amber. Also, it is a popular tourist region and widely visited by tourists from many countries, the local users can find the website useful and interesting too.
  -	Perhaps, it would be beneficial to the users from other non-English speaking countries to be able to have choice of a language.
  -	As a bilingual speaker, I am proud of my roots and love my first language. English is not my first language and I would like to share my progress in this Course with my family and friends, but not all of them are fluent in English.

- **Usage Page** - taking in concideration the aim of this project and the time given, I have only mentioned a tiny fraction of the areas where humans found aplication for amber. There is still so much I would like to share with the user. Amber has been used by humans since ancient times. It is studied by geologists, palaeontologists and geochemists. The use of amber in medicine, cosmetology, pharmacology and perfume industry deserves a separate website! Also, there are many legends and folksâ€™ stories about the amber.

- **Gifts Page** - perhaps, can be improved as well be providing user with the links to the websites where they can find products displayed in the gallery. Also, due to the many reasons, I was not able to provide every image with the description. Hence, that can be added at a later stage.

Also, I would like to address the following: 
   - There is corsoure pointer abailable on a screen when using Gifts' Page gallery. That aid user intuitevelly know that there is something to check/click.
   - Unfortunatelly, when exploring Gifts' Page gallery on a mobile device, there are no obveouse clues that there is the content at the back of some images. 
         
## **DESIGN**

-   ### Imagery

    -  The images for the *Landing Page* have been chosen as they are eye-catching, sutable thematically, perfect colour vise and intriguing/inviting to discover what connecting them to amber. These images help to keep page simple, slick and inviting to explore. 

    -  *Gifts Page* - a special consideration has been given to the images on this page. To follow the general style of the website and continuity, images were chosen on a white background. On it's turn that dictated some styling difficulties. After adding appropriately selected background colour and creating masonry gallery, I have realised that the page looks like ordinary Google search page. The aim was to provide user with unusual, original, exciting (even for the familiar with amber user) and useful information. That is how the idea of the gallery of the images with descriptive information at the back was born.  
   
-   ### Colour Scheme

    -  Amber is a fossilized resin that can vary in colour, ranging from yellow to brown to reddish orange. The colour of amber is influenced by the type of tree it came from and the location where it was formed, as well as other factors such as the presence of impurities and the amount of time it has been exposed to sunlight. 
    
    -  Rare amber colours include green, blue, and violet. These colours are caused by the presence of different impurities in the resin, such as iron, copper, or chlorine. Blue and green amber are highly prized for their rarity and beauty. These colours are often found in smaller pieces and are therefore more expensive than the more common yellow to brown ambers.

    Above facts had influence on my decisions when I was selecting images, specifically Landing Page once, deciding on the colours of navigation bar buttons and 'hamburger' menu background.

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/colours_choice_2.webp) 

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/colours_choice_3.webp)

    Initially, I have chosen colours intuitively. Then, I have used ColorPick Eyedropper and Color Picker from Chrome, and image with multicoloured amber to check if my choice was a good one. 

    Also, I have used to check my colour palette inspiration by using ColorSpace - Color Palettes [Generator_and_Color_Gradient_Tool](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23E4782B&sub=1)

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/amber_2.jpg) 

    ![Colour_Scheme](./assets/image/readme_page/colours_choice_1.webp)
   
-   ### Typography

    -   Google Fonts were used to import Oswald and Montserrat fonts into styles.css.  
    -   These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.
    -   At the start of the design I tried to choose fonts Google Fonts manually, but found this approach impractical and time consuming. I can recall that whilst working on Love Running project in one of the videos Google Font had feature of paring fonts. Unfortunately, this function is not available now (as a least, I have not been able to find it); and users have to pick fonts manually. 
    -   My student son did not approve choice of the fonts I made. Therefore, I and my son tried to research the topic of good font choices. Reading through several resources, I liked information provided at Sergei Davidov on Web Design [The_30_Best_Font_Combinations_for_Web_Design_(2022)](https://elementor.com/blog/font-pairing/)

-   ### Wireframes

    - Though, wireframes are not mandatory in web design but they are widely used as a best practice to help clarify design goals and requirements, improve collaboration between designers and stakeholders, and streamline the design and development process.
    
    - I fully support and aunderstand that wireframes are important for web design as they provide a visual representation of the layout and structure of a website before it is built, helping to ensure that the end product meets the design goals and requirements.

    - Unfortunatelly, I don't have a dissent Wireframe to produce on this occasion. This is the best I have got at the moment:
