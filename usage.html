                Amber boasts a considerable range of useful properties. In addition to its unique decorative features,
                it has a set of characteristics that allow it to be widely used for a variety of purposes. Therefore,
                amber is a material not only for jewellery, <strong><a href="gifts.html">expensive
                        souvenirs</a></strong>, but also as a raw material for industrial products.
                <br>
                <br>
                Amber has been faithfully serving science for centuries, and many industries cannot do without it.

                In modern industry, contaminated minerals and amber production waste are used: debris, crumbs and flour.
                In general, anything that is not suitable for the production of jewellery and products, or left over
                from it. There are many fields of human endeavor in which amber has been used in a different way from
                what we are accustomed to.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>In physics</strong> the mineral used to be used to make magnifying glasses, lenses
                for spectacles and eyepieces for microscopes. Amber-based glassware is better than a traditional
                glassware. It worked perfectly for the visual approximation of objects and the magnification of their
                size, but the fragility of the material forced scientists to resort to ordinary glass. And, in museums,
                you can also find electroscopes and spirit meters made of amber.

                <strong>In pharmacology</strong> since ancient times, the fossil resin has been renowned as a cure-all
                for many ailments: it was believed that a small piece of it could cure male ailments and heal the soul.
                The sun stone's high content of iron, zinc, potassium and iodine makes it indispensable in
                pharmaceuticals for creating medicines. For example, oils which help to quickly treat injuries, sprains,
                joint pains; relieve muscular pain, treat respiratory disorders, relieve coughing fits.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>In medicine</strong> amber is used to make utensils, devices and instruments for blood
                transfusion and preservation. The reason is that the mineral does not absorb moisture and does not let
                the plasma "clot".

                <br>
                <strong>In agriculture</strong> used as an organic stimulant to improve seed quality. And later on, to
                make the plants grow better, bloom better and produce a good harvest.

                <strong>In art</strong>, Stradivari - the famous violinmaker who made musical instruments at the
                turn of
                the seventeenth and twentieth centuries, covered his pieces with amber lacquer. Perhaps that is why
                Antonio was able to achieve the perfect sound of his instruments, which even hundreds of years later
                are
                still being hunted by collectors. And the phenomenon of the violins he made was covered with
                mystical
                details.
