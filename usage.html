                    This is all about amber, the most amazing and little-studied mineral of the universe. Hand
                    workmanship
                    makes amber pieces unique, and the delicate, scrupulous work of a master craftsman helps to
                    accentuate
                    the natural beauty of the gem. Precious settings give the amber jewellery an utterly captivating
                    look.

                    Amber boasts a considerable range of useful properties. In addition to its unique decorative
                    features,
                    it has a set of characteristics that allow it to be widely used for a variety of purposes.
                    Therefore,
                    amber is a material not only for jewellery, <strong><a href="gifts.html">expensive
                            souvenirs</a></strong>, but also as a raw material for industrial products.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Amber has been faithfully serving science for centuries, and many industries cannot do without it.

                    About 800 tonnes of gemstones are mined around the world every year, but only 10-15% of them are
                    suitable for jewellery purposes. What happens to the rest?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In modern industry used contaminated minerals and amber production waste, such as debris, crumbs and
                    flour. In general, anything that is not suitable for the production of jewellery and products, or
                    left over from it. There are many fields of human endeavor in which amber has been used in a
                    different
                    way from what we are accustomed to.

                    <strong>In physics</strong> the mineral used to be used to make magnifying glasses, lenses
                    for spectacles and eyepieces for microscopes. Amber-based glassware is better than a traditional
                    glassware. It worked perfectly for the visual approximation of objects and the magnification of
                    their size, but the fragility of the material forced scientists to resort to ordinary glass. And, in
                    museums, you can also find electroscopes and spirit meters made of amber.

                    <strong>In pharmacology</strong> since ancient times, the fossil resin has been renowned as a
                    cure-all for many ailments: it was believed that a small piece of it could cure male ailments and
                    heal
                    the soul. The sun stone's high content of iron, zinc, potassium and iodine makes it indispensable in
                    pharmaceuticals for creating medicines. For example, oils which help to quickly treat injuries,
                    sprains, joint pains; relieve muscular pain, treat respiratory disorders, relieve coughing fits.

                    <br>
                    <strong>In medicine</strong> amber is used to make utensils, devices and instruments for blood
                    transfusion and preservation. The reason is that the mineral does not absorb moisture and does not
                    let
                    the plasma "clot".

                    Amber oil is used to create varnish. <strong>In art</strong>, Stradivari - the famous violinmaker
                    who made musical instruments at the turn of the seventeenth and twentieth centuries, used amber
                    varnish
                    to cover his pieces. Perhaps, that is why Antonio was able to achieve the perfect sound of his
                    instruments, which even hundreds of years later are still being hunted by collectors. And the
                    phenomenon of the violins he made was covered with mystical details.
                    <br>
                    Amber oil is used to impregnate wood (furniture, ship hulls, buildings and even railway sleepers),
                    thus preventing it from rotting. It is also used in foundries as a moulding oil, and as a flotation
                    oil
                    for enriching ores of various minerals and coal.

                    <br>
                    Amber acid (succinic acid) is not only useful for people. <strong>In agriculture</strong> used as an
                    organic stimulant to improve seed quality. And later on, to make the plants grow better, bloom
                    better and produce a good harvest. It is actively used as a natural growth stimulant for
                    <strong>plants,
                        birds
                        and animals</strong>. Even tiny doses increase yields by 15-40%.

                    This therapeutic pet collar made from natural Baltic amber is a natural protection for your pet
                    against
                    fleas and ticks. It will also normalise the thyroid gland, reduce inflammation and strengthen the
                    immune
                    system. When amber is heated by the body and rubbed against the fur, it releases terpenes that repel
                    parasites. Friction also produces an electrostatic charge that is unfavourable to fleas and ticks,
                    but
                    completely harmless to the pet.

                    The same acid is registered as a vitamin E363 food additive. It is recommended for the prevention of
                    nervous breakdowns and adaptation to difficult conditions, so it is often found in the diet of
                    athletes, the sick and the elderly.
                    <br>
                    Amber acid is used in perfumery and pharmacology, in colour photography, in the manufacture of
                    leatherette, industrial dyes and in agriculture.

                    Amber rosin (melted amber), constituting two-thirds of all processed amber, is used for production
                    of enamels and varnishes used in industrial production of tins, for covering electric wires,
                    furniture,
                    musical
                    instruments. Amber dyes are of better quality than all other paint products.

                    <br>
                    In power and instrument-making industry, properties of amber stone are used as insulating material.
                    Pressed amber is used in manufacture of medical ware, instruments and equipment for blood
                    transfusion, due to its properties preventing rapid destruction of human red blood cells.

                    <h2 id="usage_h2">The mysterious mineral that keeps itself hidden</h2>
                    Amber is also actively used in science and manufacturing, as it is used to make leather substitutes
                    and dyes, and mineral-based compounds are used to insulate wires. The canning, furniture, perfume,
                    construction and electronics industries; foundry, instrumentation, mining - amber being used in so
                    many areas.

                    <br>
                    The mineral used to be used to make cups, forks, spoons, mugs and plates. Nowadays, no one would
                    think of using such exquisite utensils for dinner parties, but a couple of centuries ago our
                    ancestors
                    were convinced that amber tableware detoxifies poisons. Even religious rites cannot do without the
                    "sun
                    stone": gems of improper quality are burnt during the church services, filling the room with sweet
                    and sacred odour of incense. Shrouded in mystery and myth, an alluring work of nature, about which
                    many
                    legends have been written... Modern technology has made it possible to learn a great deal about
                    amber, but not everything: it remains a great mystery to be apprehended, and hides many secrets.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Amber is now firmly embedded in all walks of life. It is hard to imagine a person who has never
                    enjoyed a fine piece of hardened resin, admired ancient semi-precious treasures in museum showcases,
                    or
                    at
                    least sat at a varnished table. But progress continues - perhaps, soon radiant cabochons will show
                    themselves in a new and unexpected way!
